# Responsible Consumtion and Production
***do you know what is RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION***
--------------------------
Yes, responsible consumption and production is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It refers to the need for people and organizations to adopt more sustainable practices in their consumption and production patterns, in order to reduce their environmental impact and promote social and economic well-being.

Responsible consumption means using products and services in a way that minimizes waste and pollution, and that supports sustainable development. This can involve using products with lower environmental impacts, reducing energy and water usage, and minimizing waste by recycling and reusing products.

Responsible production involves adopting more sustainable practices in the design, production, and distribution of products and services. This can include reducing waste and pollution in production processes, improving the efficiency of resource use, and ensuring the safety and well-being of workers.

Overall, responsible consumption and production is about promoting more sustainable and equitable patterns of consumption and production, that help to protect the environment and support social and economic development for all.
